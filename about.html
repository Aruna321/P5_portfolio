		<h3>Life in Brief</h3>
		<p>Working through highschool at increasingly dubious locales I graduated after lettering in cross country and track twice as well as band all four years.<br>I then went to Missouri to attend Wentworth Military Academy for a year as a preparatory school for the Airforce Military Academy. There I learned exactly what I didn't want to do with my life and left to attend WSU as an engineering major finding again something I didn't want to do.<br>Two years at SFCC gave me a strong computer science background which I ended up using as my minor in pursuit of Visual Design Communications at EWU.</p>
		<h3>Interests</h3>
		<p>Having a penchant for unusual activities I snowboard, mt. bike, parkour, ice skate, and perhaps most exciting of all I rock climb!<br>Musically I have an extensive piano background as well as many years of trombone and guitar and some vocal experience as well.</p>
